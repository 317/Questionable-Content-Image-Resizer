# Questionable-Content-Image-Resizer
Chrome hotfix to the weird resizing of questionable content's images 

Conditions for the bug to appear (as far as I know): 
- Chrome
- Ad-block installed (in my case Ublock Origin)
- Navigating into the archives

This script will delete the empty row that causes the problem.
