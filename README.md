# Questionable-Content-Image-Resizer
Chrome and Firefox hotfix to the weird resizing of questionable content's images. 

Conditions for the bug to appear (as far as I know): 
- Chrome, Firefox
- Ad-block installed (in my case Ublock Origin)
- Navigating into the archives

This script will delete the empty row that causes the problem.

## What do I do?
1. Install the plugin [tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/). It will allow you to add those kind of script. 
2. Click on the icon on the right of your browser and click again on "Add new script"
3. Copy/Paste the content of `script.js` in the editor window that just opened
4. Enjoy. 

## Can I install it on Greasemonkey?
Maybe. I don't really know. I tried to make it work with Greasemonkey but it appears to be quite buggy on Firefox nowadays..?
